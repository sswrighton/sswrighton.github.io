## About {{ site.name }}

<img class="user-avatar" src="{{ site.owner.avatar }}">

I am a simple software engineer, trying to make my way through this world. I'm crazy about science fiction, anime, comics and Star Wars. Yet the most important thing in my life is my wife and kids.

After graduating with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information systems from the [University of West Florida](http://www.uwf.edu), I worked for a number of years for a [Techsoft](https://www.techsoft.com/) as a Software Developer. After a few years, I moved to Jackson, spent a few months working for Sak's IT department and ultimately took a job with [Software Consulting Services, LLC](https://www.BeTheGeek.com), or SCS, as a Senior Software Engineer.  

As a member of the SCS team, I've built a number of applications used by both government and industry, including the [Electronic Filing Depository](https://www.efdnasaa.org) which allows users to submit Form D and Form NF UIT Securities Filings to participating states. 

In 2019, I recieved a promotion to Chief Information Officer at SCS. As CIO, I'm responsible for the development team, all development related project engagements as well as the software support team. I also direct SCS in regards to the tools, patterns, practices and standards for how SCS designs, builds, manages and maintains software projects.

In 2022 I was further promoted to being the Chief Operating Officer which effectively means I'm responsible for all business that the company performs. Currently, my focus is primarily revolved around building processes, procedures and ensuring proper project management for all aspects of the business, as we prepare ourselves for continued growth of employees, clients and the company. 

In addition to spending time with my wife and kids, I'm an avid wood carver and woodturner.
