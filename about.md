## About {{ site.name }}

<img class="user-avatar" src="{{ site.owner.avatar }}">

I am a simple software engineer, trying to make my way through this world. I'm crazy about science fiction, anime, comics and Star Wars. Yet the most important thing in my life is my wife and kids.

After graduating with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information systems from the [University of West Florida](http://www.uwf.edu), I worked for a number of years for a [Techsoft](https://www.techsoft.com/) as a Software Developer. After a few years, I moved to Jackson, spent a few months working for Sak's IT department and ultimately took a job with [Software Consulting Services, LLC](https://www.BeTheGeek.com) as a Senior Software Engineer.  

As a member of the SCS team, I've built a number of applications used by both government and industry, including the [Electronic Filing Depository](https://www.efdnasaa.org) which allows users to submit Form D and Form NF UIT Securities Filings to participating states. 

In addition to spending time with my wife and kids, I'm an avid wood carver and woodturner.
