<a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight version 1.0</a> has been finally released. Now to find some time to play with this. Oh well.<br /><br />What is Silverlight?  Well, the Silverlight web page describes it as thus:<br /><blockquote>     Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Silverlight™ is a cross-browser, cross-platform plug-in for delivering     the next generation of .NET based media experiences and rich interactive applications     for the Web. Silverlight offers a flexible programming model that supports AJAX,     VB, C#, Python, and Ruby, and integrates with existing Web applications. Silverlight     supports fast, cost-effective delivery of high-quality video to all major browsers     running on the Mac OS or Windows.</blockquote>Basically, imagine a version of Flash where you can build and utilize ASP.NET web application within it.
