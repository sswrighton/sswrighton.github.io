Joel's Sharepoint blog <a href="http://www.sharepointjoel.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?List=0cd1a63d-183c-4fc2-8320-ba5369008acb&amp;ID=119">points to a new</a> MS technology named Azure which was released as a CTP for developers today. Being the geek that I am, I was interested so I followed the link over to the site, and saw this pretty link labeled: Azure for Web Developers.<br /><br />Even more interested, I followed said link, which is when I got this image:<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/SQYltw3r8DI/AAAAAAAAAbU/aVV7VMz_gtU/s1600-h/msAzure.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 144px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/SQYltw3r8DI/AAAAAAAAAbU/aVV7VMz_gtU/s200/msAzure.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261934682771812402" border="0" /></a><br />Just in case you don't want to click on the picture to make it bigger, that little line of text states:  <blockquote>The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.</blockquote>Now, I love MS development paradigms. The .NET Framework is my friend.  Yet, this does not bode well for the future.  We'll have to see where they take it from here.
