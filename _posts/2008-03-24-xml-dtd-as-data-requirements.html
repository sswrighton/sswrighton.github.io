I've forgotten how much I've enjoyed generating requirements. There's something almost soothing about generating a System Specification from a bunch of functional descriptions, and then derive that down to a series of Software Requirements Specs which can be used to actually build software.<br /><br />It's fun.<br /><br />Anyways, now that I'm about to push on to design documents, I realize that I'll need to generate some DTDs for XML Messages which I'll be sending back and forth as well as utilizing as local data storage.<br /><br />Luckily, I have found a tool for that. <a href="http://www.hitsw.com/xml_utilites/">Hit Software has an online converter </a>which takes in an XML file and generates either a DTD or an XML SCHEMA. Additionally, you can import a DTD and get back the XML SCHEMA. Makes generating those things bunches easier.
