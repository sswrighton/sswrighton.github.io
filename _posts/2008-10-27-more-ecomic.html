The latest release can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ecomic/">here</a>. Now that that's out of the way, first I want to show off the new application icon. I like it. It just screams comic book to me.<br /><br />Next thing to talk about in regards to this, was the sheer amount of THINGS that the new version does. Everything from GAMMA filtering to spellchecking to thumbnailing the archive. Of course the spellcheck functionality still isn't put out where most folks can get at it, as I'm still working on a really viable datastore for the system.<br /><br />My heart is telling me that I need some data in a database for some of the functionality I'm aiming for, but at the same time I'm not going to force folks to download and install SQL Express just to run this thing.<br /><br />It's getting bloated enough as is.<br /><br />That said, I also don't want to use XML files as they're not an ideal solution for data searching and maintaining relational data concepts.<br /><br />I tried SQL Server Compact Edition, but the last time I tried to install it, my computer threw up, and took away a large number of my programs, forcing me to do a destructive format on my box.  Alas, I'll have to see what I dream up. <br /><br />And just for the fun of it, here's the Changelog for the new version:<br /><ol><li>Fixed Startup Issue where PC would launch multiple instances of the application when double-clicking an associated file</li><li> Made Temp file clean up more robust</li><li>Added in "Go To Page by Thumbnail" functionality</li><li>Organized Source Code</li><li>Added Slide show option to Image Viewer</li><li>Generated Options Dialog</li><li>Added in a Gamma Filter</li><li>Made Gamma Filter preservable via the OPTIONS dialog, or per archive via the Image Viewer Context Menu</li><li>Added in a Adjust Color Filter</li><li>Made Adust Color Filter preservable via the OPTIONS dialog, or per archive via the Image Viewer Context Menu</li><li>Added in a Contrast Filter</li><li>Made Contrast Filter preservable via the OPTIONS dialog, or per archive via the Image Viewer Context Menu</li><li>Added in a Brightness Filter</li><li>Made Brightness Filter preservable via the OPTIONS dialog, or per archive via the Image Viewer Context Menu</li><li>Added in a Color Inversion filter</li><li>Added in a grayscale filter</li><li>Actually implmented SAVE functionality</li><li>Began working with the ComicInfo.xsd file</li><li>Made new Application Icon</li><li>New MAIN window</li><li>Image Viewer </li><li>Spellcheck added to Archive Editor</li></ol>
