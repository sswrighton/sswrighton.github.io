My main focus at work is merging some C .LIB precompiled libraries into a form that can be used by my VB.NET GUI.<br /><br />One would think that this would be a simple, straightforward process.<br /><br />Maybe if I knew more about C++ it would be. But as it stands, it's nothing more than a comedy of errors and hassles, designed to drive me batty.<br /><br />The latest issue is I've got a string, and I'm trying to move the string from HEX to BINARY. Not a big deal?<br /><br />.... yeah right.<br /><br />I'm getting a <span style="font-weight: bold;">System.ArgumentException</span> complaining about a pointer being in the bottom 64K of the process's address space.<br /><br />I have no clue how it got there - nor how to get it out.<br /><br />Go, Microsoft on that one.
