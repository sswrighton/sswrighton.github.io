<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ecomic/"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/SQYKmuzoqEI/AAAAAAAAAbM/cyJIuSctIwc/s288/ecomic_icon-004.png" alt="Get eComic" style="margin: 10pt 10px 0px 0pt; float: right; cursor: pointer;" border="0" /></a>Well, at least proverbially--after all, there's no shelves involved over at CodePlex. Anyways, I'm ecstatic as I checked the download count and it was at 42 on Wednesday, but when I checked it this morning it was at 58. And that's just for this latest version.<br /><br />I've yet to get a single comment or "issue" on the software, which I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one. I mean the 58 downloads (half of which are the source code) means that there's some folks at least looking at my application.<br /><br />But if no one is finding any issues, does that mean it's made right or does it mean that it's just not getting used.<br /><br />For the record, eComic has had a total of 92 downloads (source and application).<br /><br />I just wish I knew more about actual usage, and not just the downloads. I guess I could add in some "registration" nonsense during the install process, but that's just lame, and annoying.<br /><br />Hopefully, I'll have a bit of time come the new year to add in some more functionality, as I'm still wanting to add in the "Reading List" function and give it the ability to create CBZ files.<br /><br />Anyways, I just wanted to toss that out there, as I'm happy that something I made is getting used.
