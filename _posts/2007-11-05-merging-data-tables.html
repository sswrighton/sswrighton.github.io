I found myself in a situation where I was loading a data table with data, and then possibly bringing in additional data.  I knew that .NET 1.1 the ability to merge whole datasets was included, but little did I know how they upgraded that in .NET 2.0.<br /><br />I was playing with the underlying table of data, and found the .MERGE command. Surprised, I did a quick Google search on it, and found this article <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/mahesh/DataTable2011172005235038PM/DataTable20.aspx">describing all the changes to the ADO.NET DataTable class</a>.<br /><br />Now, if they had only included an APPEND capability, I'd have been even happier.
