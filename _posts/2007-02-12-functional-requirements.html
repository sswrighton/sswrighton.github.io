I think I've found the second most exhausting thing in the world to do.<br /><br />Which of course is to sit down and discuss functional requirements with a user. Users know what they want - they just have a hard time explaining it in a way that makes sense to programmers.<br /><br />Oh well, the important thing is that the meeting was successful and the functional requirements for my current project at work are for the most part nailed down.<br /><br /><br /><br />And for those of you who may be wondering, the most exhausting thing in the world is chasing a four year old through a park.
