<p>Well, I've finally gotten off my lazy backside and implemented a new version of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ecomic/">eComic</a>.&#160; It's been up for less than 6 hours and it has already been downloaded 6 times.&#160; Not bad for such a specialized application.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/S0dX5-TeYYI/AAAAAAAAA9A/J24wx4rxnVU/s1600-h/ecomic20100108%5B9%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="eComic" border="0" alt="eComic" align="left" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/S0dX6Uw7RsI/AAAAAAAAA9E/iCPQblFrBJI/ecomic20100108_thumb%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="154" height="166" /></a>Of course the primary reason I work on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ecomic/">eComic</a> is to ensure that my skills stay nifty and sharp, as well as a place to learn new tricks and technologies for my particular field.&#160; </p>  <p>Which is why that as soon as I get both the SDK and my new phone I'll try working on an ANDROID version of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ecomic/">eComic</a>. </p>  <p>But that's neither here nor there. If you compare this to the previous version you'll notice a few things, including that the navigation box is once again on the side. I felt that it just consumed too much of the reader's screen real estate at the bottom, especially with the thought that wide-screen monitors are becoming more prevalent.</p>  <p>Secondly, if you look to the left side of things, then you'll see that there's a ZOOM control. In addition to the slider that will allow precise (in a manner of speaking) control of the zoom, there are also a <strong>1:1</strong> button which makes the image to be its &quot;true&quot; size and a <strong>FILL</strong> button which makes the control perform a &quot;Uniform&quot; fill of the image currently displayed.</p>  <p>I considered those necessary with the things like the new Microsoft tablets and netbooks that are out there, and just anyone that doesn't have the 19+ inch monitors.</p>  <p>At the bottom, there now resides a STATUS bar, which provides little things such as the current page being viewed, as well as the name of the file. I plan on having it also provide other details that can be found in the XML objects that can be associated with a CBR file.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>So, for my next trick, this is my current plan of attack in regards to functionality for this:</p>  <ul>   <li>Work on display XML data in status bar </li>    <li>Provide way to view NOTES text (either from a Notes.txt file or appropriate field from XML file </li>    <li>Provide keyboard short-cuts for Menu Items found in the Ribbon bar </li>    <li>Work on CBR (well, actually CBZ as creating RAR files requires the purchase of a library while creating ZIP files is free) editor </li>    <li>Work on the GNZ editor </li>    <li>Implement the 7z decompression function (cb7) </li> </ul>  <p>As always, content for <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ecomic/">eComic</a> can be found in many locations, or even built yourself by scanning in your newly purchased comics.</p>  <p>But two sites that provide free (and typically public domain) content for eComic are:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://goldenagecomics.co.uk/">Golden Age Comics</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.actionagecomics.com/">The Action Age!</a> </li> </ul>
