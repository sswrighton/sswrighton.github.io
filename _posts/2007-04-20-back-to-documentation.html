I never thought that I would enjoy getting back into a bit of documentation.<br /><br />But that's what's happened.<br /><br />Basically, I  got some feedback back on the lowest of my design documents (DBDD &amp; SDD), so I put off the research into getting the library working with .NET and jumped back into documentation mode. I've never been so happy to open up a Database Design Description. Monday I get to play around with fixing my SDD - and with the sheer number of screw-ups I made there, I'll probably be doing that until I'm so worn out of documentation that I can jump back into the research/coding thing.
