Well at least partly. The last post here, I was complaining about the behavior of my drag/drop divs which I created from data returned from the web server. Well the Firefox behavior is still there and annoying.<br /><br />But the IE behavior I seem to have figured out.<br /><br />I was using the command DIV.setAttribute("class", "MyDivClass"); to set the class attribute. That command works in Firefox - but apparently not in IE. IE requires DIV.className = "MyDivClass";.<br /><br />Just one of those small annoyances which is the difference between IE and Mozilla browsers. Frankly, I'm scared to open the site in Opera to see what happens.
