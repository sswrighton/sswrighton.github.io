It's a great little thing, with what amounts to two panels (one for thumbnails, properties, etc and the other for the actual image) and my personal favorite of UI chioces: the Ribbon control.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I like the ribbon so much, but I do like the paradigm behind it.<br /><br />Anyways, the technologies hiding in this thing are as follows:<br /><ul><li>Ribbon Menu Control<br /></li><li>WPF<br /></li><li>WPF Layouts</li><li>Scroll Viewers</li><li>Zip Library</li><li>WPF Image Control</li><li>WPF Tab Control<br /></li></ul>And that's just the major things that I can remember off the top of my head.<br /><br />And I'm not above admitting that it's taken me a bit to get it into this state of being able to work it. Sure, it only took a few hours to get the base system up and running, but it was ugly. The main window looked nice with its Ribbon component, but the Image Viewer popped up as a secondary window that lacked the Ribbon control. <br /><br />It was in essence the very paradigm I was trying to escape from by moving the application to WPF.<br /><br />Which meant that it was back to the research boards, and hunting for a way around the problem. Enter the Tab Control.  I was able to override the style associated with the header of the tab, and make each of them have a label and a little "X" button. <br /><br />Once that was in place, it was a simple matter of ripping out the <span style="font-style: italic;">ImageViewer </span>as a WPF form and create the <span style="font-style: italic;">ImageViewer </span>as a user control which can be added to a Tab Item. This is the paradigm that you get to see in the picture above.<br /><br />Anyways, I've finally got all those little things sorted, and began doing communication, information exchange and UI changes from the various tab-based <span style="font-style: italic;">ImageViewers </span>and the Thumbnail tab that hangs out on the left hand side of the application.<br /><br />Next up the Resume Reading, Next &amp; Previous Archives buttons.
