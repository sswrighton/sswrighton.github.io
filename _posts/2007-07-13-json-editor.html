I love JSON for use in JavaScript functionality. It's easier, faster and just better to use than XML in the same scenarios.<br /><br />The only problem with it, is it's a hassle to format properly sometimes. Especially if you're dealing with dynamic data on the server side.<br /><br />Well <a href="http://www.thomasfrank.se/">Thomas Frank</a> has now put together a JSON Editor. It runs online or you can download a copy to run locally.<br /><br />http://www.thomasfrank.se/json_editor.html
