An interesting article stumbled across my RSS Reader entitled <a href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/blogs/the_portable_web_development_toolkit">The Portable Web Development Toolkit</a>. <br /><br />Basically, it is a web development & testing environment that can fit on a thumb drive (with at least 512MB of room). <br /><br />So, I downloaded bits and peices of it (XAMPP, the portable web server mainly) and stuck it on my thumbdrive and tried to use it at the house.<br /><br />And failed. It wouldn't serve my pages.<br /><br />A tad frustrated, I took it to work, and all it managed to do was screw around with my IIS and caused me to need to reboot my machine.<br /><br />Even more frustrated, I realize that I'm going to have to figure out someway to do testing on my little PHP thing.  So, I checked to see if my webserver (hosted by GoDaddy) still ran PHP.  Happily it appeared to do so - at least until I tried to connect to a database.  So now, I'm having to contact GoDaddy support and figure out if it's just an issue with the Windows hosting or if they've removed PHP from the windows hosting all together.<br /><br />Lucky me.
