<p>Well, I finally got off my backside and slapped together the .NET 4.0 version of eComic.&#160; In addition to all the enhancements which 4.0 provides to WPF I also streamlined the opening of the archive files, and added a host of additional features.</p>  <p>The most important of these are:</p>  <ul>   <li>Rebuilt form in .NET 4</li>    <li>Rebuilt Comic opening engine to improve speed and performance</li>    <li>Removed manual zoom control</li>    <li>Implemented programmatic PAN/ZOOM functionality on mouse events and ribbon buttons</li>    <li>Added progress bar charting opening archive progress to status bar</li>    <li>Modified page number/page name to allow selection of pages via that function</li>    <li>Added icon to status bar to indicate type of file loaded</li>    <li>Added ability to open a directory of images</li>    <li>Added functionality to create simple CBZ file from an opened directory of images</li>    <li>Added support for a 'full screen' mode</li>    <li>Added additional buttons to RIBBON element for ease of access to the functions</li>    <li>Allow for DragDrop of a file from Explorer to force open</li> </ul>  <p>I'm still in the process of building documentation for the thing though, which is something I dislike, but you know how it is. </p>
