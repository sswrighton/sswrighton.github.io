Well, I've finally found a free Javascript tree control, one with a license which means I can use it in the commercial product I'm working on.<br /><br />It's available for download <strong>nowhere</strong>, and I have to say I'm pleased with it, as it uses unobtrusive JavaScript to transform a nested UL into the tree.<br /><br /><b>Edit:</b> Removed the link to the software, as it no  longer exists on the linked-to site.
