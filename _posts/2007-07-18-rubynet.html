An interesting <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/news/thread.tss?thread_id=46250">topic flashed across my RSS Reder courtesy of TheServerSide.Net. </a><br /><br />Basically, it was Ruby.NET (a .NET implementation of the Ruby programming language) is going open source.<br /><br />I like Ruby, though I've not played on it nearly enough, and I'm fairly excited about this happening, especially if WATIR and other Ruby tools (i.e. RAILS!) can be folded into the Ruby.NET implementation.<br /><br />This definitely bears further attention.
