I think <a href="http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/aspnet/A_Better_BulletedList.aspx">this article</a> on a developer's need to output HTML formatted text in one of the new .NET 2.0 web controls is probably one of the better articles on extending a control that I've seen over the past few years. <br /><br />Clear, concise, and explains a very important aspect of ensuring that you don't destroy needed features while adding new ones to a control.<br /><br /><br />Of course, on the other hand, I read this <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Purgatory/hourglassajax.asp">CodeProject article</a> and wondered why on earth the author felt that it was worthy of being an article.
