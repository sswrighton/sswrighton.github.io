Jeremy Keith presented something regarding AJAX at XTECH 2006 entitled <a href="http://domscripting.com/presentations/xtech2006/">HIJAX: Progressive Enhancement with AJAX</a>.<br /><br />I've just recently found the slides to the presentation and must say that I like the concept a lot.<br /><br />A whole lot.<br /><br />In a nutshell, what Mr. Keith advocates is that we develop webapplications with AJAX in mind, but in a traditional postback form. Minus any form of JavaScripting (such as .NET's Link buttons with are traditional <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> tags but with a JavaScript function as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">HREF</span>).<br /><br />Then once the application is built, go back and build JavaScript which hijacks the application's links and button submissions and passing the data through the XMLHttpRequest object.<br /><br />The whole purpose of the thing is to ensure that the application degrades well in downlevel browsers and/or those browsers with JavaScript turned off.<br /><br />I suggest you go look at them slideshow, it's a great working platform for rolling out AJAX applications.
