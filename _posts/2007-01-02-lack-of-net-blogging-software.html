I try to do everything on my personnel website in .NET. And I was considering moving this blog to my own website. Yet, I went searching for freeware Blogging software utilizing .NET and found very little.<br /><br />Which I found a bit odd, since Microsoft was kind enough to release .NET 2.0 with the VSE editions for free.<br /><br />Maybe that will be my next spare-time project after I complete my current one. Now to start thinking about which features I'll want.<br /><br />Things I'll probably want it to do:<br /><ul><li>Code/Design separation</li><li>Comments</li><li>WYSIWYG Editing in both FF &amp; IE</li><li>Comment Moderation</li><li>IP Banning</li><li>Maybe the ability to include it within other web applications?</li></ul>Regardless if I do this BLOG thing or not, with my next side-project, I'll be going from Design to Maintenance here in my little blog.
