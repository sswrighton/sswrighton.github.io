Technical Solution in CMMI is described as thus:<br /><blockquote>The purpose of Technical Solution is to design, develop, and implement solutions to requirements. Solutions, designs, and implementations encompass products, product components, and product-related life-cycle processes either singly or in combinations as appropriate.</blockquote><br /><br />Of course no one ever tells you just what that means - or how to apply it to real life. College courses nowhere build classes around CMMI (because it was created at Carnegie-Melon University as opposed to being developed in-house), so for the most part a degree is a useless piece of paper where CMMI is concerned.  And good luck on finding any formal training. A quick Google search revealed pretty much nothing.<br /><br />Oh well. Hopefully I can teach myself enough to get by, either that or bug our Lead Systems Engineer for the knowledge that I need.
