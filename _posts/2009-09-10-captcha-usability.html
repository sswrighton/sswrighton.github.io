Here's a secret, I despise CAPTCHA's.  I hate them. I think they are one of the most user-unfriendly form elements in existence.<br /><br />Most of the time, I can barely read them.<br /><br />I understand their purpose, and I know why they exist. But that doesn't mean that I actually like the things, and it definitely doesn't mean that I like entering data into them.<br /><br />But then there's the ones that I find are actively HOSTILE to the end user.<br /><br />After all, the usage pattern for these evil things is fairly standard, everyone knows what to do:<br /><ol><li>Squint and try and make out the relevant letters</li><li>Type those letters in as they are displayed</li><li>Press the submit icon/button/dongle/blood letting device</li></ol>This process has become ingrained. It's what we expect.<br /><br />Which is where I get to that hostile statement above.<br /><br />I found one of these captchas, and entered the data, and it came back invalid.<br /><br />So I entered it again, with the same results.<br /><br />And again, and again.<br /><br />Finally, I was starting to want to smack the website's author when I noticed something.<br /><br />Instructions.<br /><br />Who puts instructions on a captcha I thought to myself as I began to read.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/SqkI3HNHbUI/AAAAAAAAA5w/oDAj9D7di70/s1600-h/hostilecaptcha.png"><img style="margin: 10px auto; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 50px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/SqkI3HNHbUI/AAAAAAAAA5w/oDAj9D7di70/s320/hostilecaptcha.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5379840972790656322" border="0" /></a><br />For posterity, I made a screen shot. And in case you were wondering, this is the context of that block of text:<br /><span class="gen"></span><blockquote><span class="gen">Confirmation code <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">READ THIS INSTRUCTION CAREFULLY</span>: * </span><br /><span class="gensmall"><b>Type a lower-case "w" into the box and then follow it</b> with the code exactly as you see it. The code is case sensitive and zero has a diagonal line through it. The initial "w" is necessary - the system will reject your registration if you do not include it</span></blockquote>Yes, they REQUIRE you to type a lower-case "w" as the first letter of the field.<br /><br />Why? As far as I know it's just to annoy anyone trying to register for their site.<br /><br />My ultimate thought: poor, poor design.
