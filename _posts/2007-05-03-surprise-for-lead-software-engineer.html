The wife is sick this week - so I missed work Tuesday which postponed a meeting until this morning (well, technically, it was yesterday morning now, as it's well after midnight when I'm posting this). I was hoping that it would be a quick thing and she'd be back on her feet after having a day's rest - but she wasn't. So I had went down to the office for a quick meeting and after that took her to the hospital. Apparently she has a rather nasty kidney infection. She's on an antibiotic now, so hopefully she'll be feeling better real soon.<br /><br />Anyways, my main project at work is now over. The deliverable was a number of requirement and design documents, with any coding we accomplished basically icing on the cake. What this means is that I get to spend a few more hours cleaning up my SDD and then it's off to another project.<br /><br />Or a group of them at least.<br /><br />One of my co-workers who's wife is about to have a child is lead Software Engineer for three ASP.Net projects.  And I'm getting shoved over onto those projects. Which means that while he's out on 'maternity leave' that I get to do that lead Software Engineer stuff for those projects.<br /><br />Yeah, go me.<br /><br />Anyhow, the first of those projects has been running for a few years now, and has gone through three iterations on the underlying processing engine and two iterations on how it generates the end product. I was highly involved in the design and development of that processing engine - with the current thing being a series of dynamically created controls which query the user for information to generate the output, and all of this is happening on a single ASPX page.<br /><br />It's a beautiful design and I'm quite fond of it. <br /><br />Yet, there were certain requirements which made that solution viable for that product. First it was a Web Application not a Website. Secondly, it had a linear flow of data collection. Third, the user should always enter the application in the same way. And finally, the data is loosely coupled to the database.<br /><br />What that last means is that there are no distinct data structures in the database that relate to a given page of the Web Application. All data is stored in the same data table, with the system not caring which page it came from.<br /><br />Once the design was implemented, such a thought wasn't nearly as complicated as it sounds.<br /><br />Anyways, the latest project's prototype (BlackBelt) is being built in a similar manner. More or less, a stripped down version of the first project's design.<br /><br />Of course, while I was being briefed on BlackBelt, I pointed out the flaw in his thinking. Namely that the new project doesn't meet all the needs of a site which that design would be useful for.  BlackBelt is not a linear data collection tool, it collects a certain set of data on a single page. That page would have no relation to any other page. Then the data structures in the database are tightly coupled to the pages (i.e. every page has a table or view which it directly reads/populates). Finally, the user may wish to enter directly to a single, specific page.<br /><br />For example, if User A only uses Page 3, and that's the only page he ever uses, then he would want to create a link to Page 3. With the current engine, that  is just not possible. There's only 1 page - and it requires PostBack information (the user selecting which page to view) for the application to know what controls to display. Basically, what that means is that for User A to get to Page 3 requires the user to hit two different pages of the application. That's not a good usability point right there.<br /><br />Anyways, the point of my story is that as I was telling him that we shouldn't use my design for this application, his face kind of got that confused, deer-in-the-headlights look. Apparently, it kind of shocked him that I was telling him that it was a bad idea to use my design for this site, especially since I pushed him into using it's forerunners in the first two iterations of that first project.<br /><br />Oh well, BlackBelt is just a prototype anyways. Created solely to derive requirements so we can build the real product.
