ASP.Net (the website) has a series of tutorials on building a three-tiered data architecture using ASP.Net 2.0 (<a rel="noopener" href="http://www.asp.net/learn/dataaccess/default.aspx?tabid=63">view the tutorial here</a>).<br /><br />And for the most part, it is a good series. The only thing that I kind of disagree with is their decision to use typed DataSets as the data access layer.<br /><br />While sure, that creates a form of data independence, as you're not building SQL strings through out your code, it still doesn't feel like a data access layer.<br /><br />Personally, on sites that I may need to switch the back end database for, I create an interface, which performs all the tasks I need, plus a few extras, such as RunStoredProcedure, RunNonQuery, RunQuery, and GetDataSet.<br /><br />Since there is an interface for all DataReaders, I return that from my interface - giving me the ability to be database agnostic.<br /><br />The code class that I use for manipulating the database I will place in a separate DLL, and then use reflection to instantiate that object in the Global.Application_Startup event handler. Making my data access layer, a global object (where I've long stashed other global variables which are stored in the Web.Config file).<br /><br />So My project solution will look like this:<br /><ul><li>Web Project</li><li>Database Interface</li><li>SQL Server Data Accessor</li><li>Oracle Data Accessor</li><li>MySQL Data Accessor</li></ul>Sure, there is a slight performance hit on using reflection and late-binding the data access layer, but that is a trade off I willingly took for my code to be database agnostic.
