I love Firefox. It's a  great browser, and my favorite part of Firefox is the extensions which you can add into to expand the browser's functionality.<br /><br />Things such as ColorPicker, MeasureIt and Nuke Anything Enhanced I have long had on my browser. Lately, I've been playing around with GreaseMonkey. But I routinely look through the extensions to see if something new has been released that I would like to use or that would be helpful for me as a web developer.  The last time I checked, I only found GreaseMonkey and Lori (a life-of-request information status bar extension).  Tonight though, I had a bit of extra time and found myself three great new extensions.<br /><ul><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2076/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">JSView</span>. </a>This extension allows you to view linked in files (such as style sheets and external JavaScript files). Quite often when I am viewing source, these files are what I'm hunting down to look at, so I think this is a great little tool for my toolbox.</li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4276/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Header Spy</span></a>. I'm not 100% certain on how useful this thing will be. But it's going to show me my HTTP headers on my status bar. It should be fun, at least for a bit.</li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1190/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">OperaView</span></a>. I've long had IEView in my extensions list, as I find it useful to not have to launch the full browser, especially when I'm at home with only one monitor to look at. So when I found this one, I just had to add it into my little stash of things.</li></ul>And of course, since I now also run GreaseMonkey, I also have to search for useful GreaseMonkey scripts.<br /><br />Such as this <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/greasemonkey/linkify.user.js">one</a>, which ensures that all URLs displayed in the browser are clickable links. I don't know how many times I've come across some blob of text, usually on some social or Web 2.0 website where it's a non-clickable URL.  Unfortunately, the usefulness of GreaseMonkey scripts are not always 100% apparent.
