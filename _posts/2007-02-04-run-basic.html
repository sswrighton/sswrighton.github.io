A week or so ago, I read an essay from a rather well-known science-fiction writer complaining about the fact that he was unable to find a simple, free and easy-to-use BASIC  compiler which he could use with his son to build those sample exercises that grammar school math books always seems to have at the end of the chapter.<br /><br />Enter <a href="http://runbasic.com/">Run BASIC</a>.<br /><br />It's a web-based BASIC compiler. I'm talking the old-style BASIC, which I learned how to code in on a Commodore 64 way back in the day. Useful? Probably not that much, but it sure is fun!
