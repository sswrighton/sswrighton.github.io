I use Google Reader. I've always enjoyed it immensely, and have used it extensively since it was first released.&nbsp; I've tried other RSS Readers, but frankly, none of them offered me the flexibility which Google Reader provided.<br /><br />Then they added "social" features. Users could "Like" and "Share" RSS items. While I never used the Like feature (and would install a browser add-in which would hide it) I used the Share feature to share links on this blog.<br /><br />Now, I'm not up in arms about the loss of this feature, though I will miss it. Why I'm posting this, is that I received the updated UI this afternoon, and noticed that in the Tips and tricks, there was a big old article on how to share SHARED items on a blog.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JHZVT_AYQmg/Tq8WYswFhKI/AAAAAAAABEs/GpL94YvYf9Q/s1600/greader.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="262" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JHZVT_AYQmg/Tq8WYswFhKI/AAAAAAAABEs/GpL94YvYf9Q/s320/greader.png" width="320" /></a></div>I mean, talk about rubbing salt into the wound of those 10,000+ users that were begging (and signing petitions) Google to keep that particular feature...
