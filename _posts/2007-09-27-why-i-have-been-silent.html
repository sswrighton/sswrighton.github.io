As the three of you who consistently check this blog via RSS feeds know, I've been silent here for nearly twenty days. No updates, no dumps of knowledge, nothing.<br /><br />The reason for this is because I'm in the process of moving.<br /><br />I've gotten a new job with SAKS Inc. which I start about halfway through the month of October. It's a developer's position, doing a lot of the same stuff that I'm doing now (ASP.Net with a SQL Server backend).<br /><br />Truth be told, there is still some issues on just what I'll be able to blog about in concerns to the new position, but in the end, I'll always have my freelance stuff to fall back on to bring out my thoughts and concerns.<br /><br />I'll try to be more vocal here, but a lot of my energy is currently being spent on getting my projects at my current employer wrapped up into a state where someone can easily come in behind me and take them over, as well as getting everything packed up and even trying to find a house up in Jackson where we're going.<br /><br />It's scary. I'm something of a home body, and am very comfortable where I live. I like Pensacola. I've been here for 26 of my 30 years. Yet, just liking a city isn't enough of a reason to pass up such a great opportunity, both career-wise and pay-wise, that SAKS is offering me.
