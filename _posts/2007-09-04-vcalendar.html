Well, I find myself working on an application that deals with generating elections, and one of the issues is the fact that users need to be reminded to vote.<br /><br />Well, I had the wonderful idea of using ICS files so that users can download and input them automatically into whichever calendaring application they prefer.<br /><br />Well, a bit of searching turned up <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vb/net/vcalendar.asp">these classes on CodeProject</a> to make implementation of the generation of the ICS files easier.<br /><br />This makes the "Future Elections" page much more useful from the voter's point of view. Major points in the usability department.
