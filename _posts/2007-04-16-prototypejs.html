For my freelance project, I'm using the PROTOTYPE JavaScript library as a means to enable AJAX functionality easily into my website.<br /><br />But for whatever reason - the functionality pretty much refuses to behave properly. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, or if there's a problem with my configuration of FireFox or if it's something inherently hard about Prototype.<br /><br />All I know is that I don't need this much hassle - so what I'm going to do is kill the AJAX aspects of the pages, and make it a traditional web application. At least until I get the system working and stable. Then I can go in and layer in AJAX functionality on top of the website to make it more responsive and like a desktop client.<br /><br />I'm just bothered by the whole hassle of the thing.
