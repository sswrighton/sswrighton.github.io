<span></span><br /><div style="-en-clipboard: true;">&nbsp;Wikipedia defines technical debt as:&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="margin-left: 40px;">A concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.&nbsp;</blockquote><div>Which is as good of a definition for that as I've seen.&nbsp; But it doesn't tell the whole story.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But it's not the definition I think of when I reference it.&nbsp; And I know that this will get people all sorts of bent out of shape, but when I hear technical debt, I also consider it more along the lines fo this:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The implied cost of additional work caused by stagnating on the learning of technical concepts, processes, standards or behaviors.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>You can accrue technical debt by choosing the easy solution, instead of the best solution.&nbsp; But at times, customers can only afford the easy solution now.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>You can accrue technical debt by building project after project using the sames methods and methodologies time after time.&nbsp; And never looking at newer frameworks and just how other people are doing things.&nbsp; By not learning things like .NET Core or Node.js because ASP.Net&nbsp;Webforms just work.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And that's the type of technical debt that I've recently realized that I've been accruing.&nbsp; I've not learned these new things, because what I've been doing works.&nbsp; What I'm doing, how I'm building software, is not wrong, it's just I'm blind to the possibility that it's not the best solution for the issue I'm solving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Which in turn, drives that initial definition of choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that may take longer.&nbsp;</div><br />
