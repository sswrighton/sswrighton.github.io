This is probably the most sneaky of all the documents I'm writing for my current project at work. One would think it would be an easy build, just a simple document telling the design for the database tables.<br /><br />One would think.<br /><br />On the surface it is. The  document is built in this manner:<br /><ol><li>Scope</li><ol><li>Identification</li><li>Database Overview</li><li>Document Overview<br /></li></ol><li>References</li><li>Database-wide Design Decisions</li><li>Detailed Design of the Database</li><ol><li>Conceptual Design</li><li>Physical Design</li><li>Data Elements<br /></li></ol><li>Detailed Design of Database  Access/Manipulation Software</li><li>Requirements Traceability</li><li>Notes</li><ol><li>Acronyms & Abbreviations</li><li>Glossary and Definitions</li></ol></ol>It appears reasonably straightforward, but of course it's not. While I have long been able to design/draw out a database on a whiteboard for implementation - this is the first time in producing one of these documents.<br /><br />I guess it's not really that hard, at least once the needs document was fully explained to me. I can only assume that my problem came in because I couldn't find any good examples of this document type anywhere.
