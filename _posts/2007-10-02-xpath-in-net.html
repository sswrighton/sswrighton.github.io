Sometimes I'm truly oblivious to things.<br /><br />I love working with XML in .NET it's a great way to send information across the internet to disparate companies, such as UPS. Well, when parsing XML messages that I receive I use XPATH. No big deal. The problem lies in the fact that I don't do it often, so I tend to forget that first "/".<br /><br />Not a big deal. Just an hour of hunting down why I wasn't reporting the response I received from UPS.<br /><br />That, and the fact that I was doing error checking on Node.Value and Node.InnerText when only Node.InnerText was populated.
