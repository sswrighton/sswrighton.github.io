While playing on the web earlier, I found this <a rel="noopener" href="http://skindeep.logankoester.com/overcoming-coders-block">link</a> which is a discussion on overcoming "Coder's Block."<br /><br />I can understand how easy it is to be interrupted by things, and like some of the ideas which he advocates.
