I love the .NET Login controls. They're the easiest things in the world to use--provided you're happy with the arcane and more or less evil Membership tables that are generated by aspnet_regsql routine.<br /><br />And of course, I'm not.<br /><br />I often want little things like using the email address as the username. Everyone knows their email address, and in ensures that I collect that information (yes, I'm sneaky).<br /><br />Usually this means many hours of arcane coding while I implement my own versions of the Membership and Roles providers, when ultimately all I want to be doing is modifying things every so slightly.<br /><br />This is a concept that makes me ecstatically happy once I found that the source code for the SQL Membership Providers have been released by Microsoft (a fact discovered via Scott Guthrie's blog in this <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/04/13/442772.aspx">post</a>).<br /><br />Sometimes I'm so behind the curve.
