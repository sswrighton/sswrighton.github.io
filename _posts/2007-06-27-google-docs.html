Well, I logged into Google Docs this morning (much as I do every morning, it's one of my STARTUP Tabs in Firefox) and got a nice surprise.  A brand new layout for the file system.<span onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_0dC8-RtLatg/RoJeKC8dWPI/AAAAAAAAACg/LvX1PrVl2FM/s200/gogdoc.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5080726856309496050" border="0" /></span><br />Frankly, I like it a lot better than the old layout. I like the folders, and the "Outlook" style that it is using here. It's more user friendly, and more intuitive to use-after all it is the paradigm that is used by Windows File Explorer, Outlook, and Google's own GMail and Reader applications.<br /><br />I for one will not miss the pull down menus that were up there, and am glad they've made these changes.  Thanks, Google.
