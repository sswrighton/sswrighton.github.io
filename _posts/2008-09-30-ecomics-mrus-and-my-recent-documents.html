Well, my testbed for WindowsForms development has received another release. Version 0.0.1.003 of eComic is now up, and waiting for downloading over at Codeplex (http://www.codeplex.com/ecomic/).<br /><br />Quite a number of changes for this release, most of them are fixing behaviors, getting things closer to creating/using a reading list, but there were two that I really wanted to point out. These two are new classes that I added into my source code; one is a MRU Files listing, and the other adds accessed files to the "My Recent Documents" list on the user's START menu.<br /><br />The latter of the two is merely a simple WIN32 Interop wrapper for the SHELL DLL. Nothing obscenely fancy, but it works.<br /><br />The former (see the source code <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgrd4n99_319f2wfcfgn">here</a>) is a bit more involved. It's a class, which takes in 3 things: a ToolStripMenuItem object, the application's name and the number of files that can be on the MRU list. It then generates additional ToolStripMenuItems to go into the intial ToolStripMenuItem's DropDownItems attributes. <br /><br />The class itself raises an event when one of those child Menu Items are chosen, passing the selected file path &amp; name to the parent class.  I just shoved this information into the registry because that was easy for me, but it wouldn't be that hard to retrofit it to store the data into a database or even a flat file.
