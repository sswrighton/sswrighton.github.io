It's been so long since I've had content to push to this blog. After all, the work at SAKS ended up not being very mind-stimulating. Or technical. I'd hesitate to call it actual work, but for the fact that they paid me to show up, despite the fact that I didn't want to be there.<br /><br />All of that is over now. I've managed to acquire a job where I actually use all those skills I shoved into my head while working for TECHSOFT. And it's actually fun! Well, I think it's fun, but then again most people don't enjoy designing software with the same fervor as I.<br /><br />Anyways, I am now employed by a technology company here in Jackson named <a href="http://bethegeek.com/">Software Consulting Services</a> (SCS). SCS is similar to TECHSOFT, as both do hardware sales, network engineering and software engineering. So, imagine the happy dance I get to do now that I'm actually designing software once again.
