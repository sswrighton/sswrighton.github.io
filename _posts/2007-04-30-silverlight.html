This <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/30/silverlight-the-web-just-got-richer/">article </a>just came across my RSS Feed. I was interested in Silverlight previous to this, but without .NET support on the backend, I thought it would not be worth the effort to learn or develop for. Well, Microsoft has done away with my only reason to not learn how to play with this new technology. I just hope that it will be natively easier to use for us lowly developers than Flash is.<br /><br />According to the article it should be going gold sometime this summer - so I still have a few months left before I need to learn something brand, spanking new.
