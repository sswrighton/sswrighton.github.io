I finally gave in and got a GMail account last night. After all, Google is meeting so many of my various needs already, I figured why not this last one?<br /><br />Consider the tools I use on a daily basis which are produced by Google:<br /><ul><li>Google Reader</li><li>Google Groups</li><li>Blogger</li><li>Docs &amp; Spreadsheets</li><li>Browser Sync</li></ul><br />Frankly, I love these tools - having the ability to peruse my data from different computers.  My only complain concerning any of these tools is that Docs is a bit light on outline formating , tracking changes, comments and other specialized tools such as word count which I tend to use a lot, and need in my word processor.<br /><br />But, I'm a programmer, and this is a blog mainly about programming. So what does my little ecstatic escapade concerning online tools have to do with anything?<br /><br /><a href="http://gyre.bitscribe.net/">Gyre</a>.<br /><br />This is a very early (their website describes it as pre-pre-pre-alpha) web-based IDE for Rails.<br /><br />I've yet to actually use Rails (though I use Ruby and WATIR for test driving websites) but this is a strong benefit to a web language such as Rails, especially for folks like me who more and more find that everything I'm doing ends up online.
