Well, I get to play catch up in regards to some of the documentation for one of the projects I'm working on.  Basically, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">REQMP </span>section never got storyboarded for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SDD </span>replacement document for that section. So that means that I get to do so.<br /><br />Ah, the joys of random paperwork. <br /><br />It's a nice, well defined process, and all the data is on the testing website or in the database scripts which work with the UI so it's not like I have to hunt long and hard for the data, it's just a tedious cut-n-paste job. <br /><br />But, we need all our documentation in order, now don't we.
