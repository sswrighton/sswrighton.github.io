I'm a geek, and as such I have multiple and myriad, and often conflicting, interests. One such interest, as evidenced by the sheer number of blogs I have out there, is writing.  Yet, above that, I love reading.<br /><br />Which is why I enjoyed the Ficlets.com website so much. I mean here was something which allowed for numerous stories, and thousands of potential sequels, and prequels to those stories.<br /><br />Then AOL decided to close it down.  Talk about a bummer.<br /><br />So, since I am a geek, I decided to rebuild the website from the ground up (which is where <a href="http://www.theexpandeduniverse.com">TheExpandedUniverse.com</a> comes in). I don't have all the functionality which ficlets.com has, at least yet, but that's okay, as I have the fundamental aspects: stories can be written, sequels &amp; prequels to said stories can be written, and people can read and vote for them.<br /><br />Talk about fun :D.<br /><br />Well, I found it fun. Even the coding of the website was fun. I learned a host of new things, including LINQ to SQL and how to utilize Markdown and OpenID in a .NET web application.<br /><br />So, it's there, it's running; now I just get to go back in and add in the missing functionality.
