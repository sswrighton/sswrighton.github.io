I've been busy with RealLife and making some "necessary" changes to my project's SDD.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that means that I don't really have a lot to blog on, as I'm not developing any new features and mainly slamming my head against the desk at routine intervals. It also means that I'm more focused on getting that document written than reading articles and whitepapers and other blogs to garner odds an ends about Software Engineering.<br /><br />Like it says in the title, sorry.<br /><br /><br />As a side note, I'll be offline Friday and Monday, so don't expect new posts on those days either.
