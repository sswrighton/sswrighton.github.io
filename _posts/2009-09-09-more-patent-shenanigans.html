Apparently, a company has patented cross-communication between applets of an application utilizing a shared data store with both relational and objective data.<br /><br />What that means is that someone patented the concept of including those Apps in Facebook and Twitter and any other application which uses plug-ins (including FireFox and Visual Studio) and a data store and a global network.<br /><br />What is sad is that they've convinced a judge that there is reason to force Facebook to provide them the ability to review Facebook's source code.<br /><br />Yes, a United States Federal judge has told a company that they must divulge trade, copyrighted secrets to a competitor in order for that competitor to successfully sue them.<br /><br />All because Leader Technologies patented the concept of plug-in software.<br /><br />I'm sickened by this, and see it as yet another reason why software patents need to disappear forever.<br /><br />Of course if I was Facebook, I would facilitate the review of my source code by providing it in hard copy format.<br /><br />After all, Facebook wouldn't want to step on anyone's toes by possibly using infringing software that features such niceties as the "Find" function or source code formatting.
