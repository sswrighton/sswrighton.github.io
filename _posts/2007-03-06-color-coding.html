Part of my freelance project is derived from the statistical representation of large data sets. And one of the statistical representations is a color coding based on frequency. Well I had originally set it up as basically a tri-state frequency to reflect cold/warm/hot status, yet this did not meet the customer's needs.<br /><br />He wanted a range of colors based on that frequency, so now I've got to find out a way to graduate from red to blue (through yellow) based on a frequency. It shouldn't be that hard, as it's just a matter of converting the color from an RGB code.<br /><br />Of course I'm saying that from a point of ignorance. Alas, Google here I come.
