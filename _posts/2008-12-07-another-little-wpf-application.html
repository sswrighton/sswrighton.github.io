Well, I've tossed out another itty-bitty WPF application, it's located here: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/JCPMList">Jedi Council PM List</a>.  And while my other application (eComic) is very specific in its user-base, this one makes eComic look like MS Word in its potential user-base.<br /><br />It's basically designed to be used by a subset of the users of the Jedi Council forums (http://boards.theforce.net) to allow said users send their private messages as a PM List.<br /><br />Of most interest is the fact that it is web site automation via <a href="http://watin.sourceforge.net/">WATIN</a>. WATIN of course is designed for automated web testing, and is something that's needed for a couple of projects that are in the wings for me.
