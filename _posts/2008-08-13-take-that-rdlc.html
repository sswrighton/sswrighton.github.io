I posted <a href="http://programmer.wrighton.org/2008/08/rdlc-post-backs.html">yesterday</a> about some travails I was having with RDLC and the behavior of drill through reports. The basics of that was that the system was requiring a second full postback on to process any events generated by a drill through report.<br /><br />Well, after a bit of sleep, I succeeded in bypassing that whole issue.<br /><br />To get the necessary behavior, I worked in two steps. The first was in the DRILLTHROUGH event handler, and the second was in the PRERENDER event handler.<br /><br />So, first things first. Previously, in the DRILLTHROUGH event handler I was getting my data and my parameters, and setting them to the DRILLTHROUGH report. Much the way that every document out there states you're supposed to do. To that, I say BAH!! <br /><br />My solution required me to not assign the new datasets and parameters to my drillthrough report, but rather to the local report assigned to my ReportViewer class (i.e. the PARENT report).<br /><br />But, this would make the drill through report devoid of data you claim?  Well, that's the whole bit about the PRERENDER class. In there, I check the ReportViewer's LocalReport instance to determine if we're in a DRILLTHROUGH situation, and if so, then I call the PERFORMBACK function of the ReportViewer class.<br /><br />Which basically pushes us back to the parent report (i.e. the one that I assigned the new datasets to).<br /><br />Insert an appropriate level of diabolical laughter here, and then we're all sorts of good to go.  Now, onto my next problem.
