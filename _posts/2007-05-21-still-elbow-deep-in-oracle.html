Well, I'm still struggling with the differences in Oracle and SQL Server.<br /><br />I can admit that Oracle does have quite a few nice features to it. It's a great system.<br /><br />Yet SQL Server beats it hands down as far as ease of use is concerned. Especially for those of us who don't use it on a daily basis.<br /><br />For example, I want to find out what types are the columns of a given table. In SQL Server, I'd just open up either Server Explorer or Query Analzyer and lo and behold they'd be right there. Heck, I could even just connect VS 2005 to the database and have access to that data.<br /><br />Oracle's SQL Plus? No clue. I'm sure there's some arcane SQL command to get that information, but I've yet to discover it on Google<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE: </span>I found out how to get that type of data. In SQL*Plus (Oracle's odd command window for stuff) you run the command <span style="font-style: italic;">DESC <tablename></span> and it provides a description for the specified table (column name, type and if it allows nulls).<br /><br />Oh well. I guess that's why they have the WEB Interface.
