I've finally found a <a href="http://www.globalknowledge.com/training/course.asp?pageid=9&courseid=8107&amp;catid=436&&amp;country=United+States&translation=English">Requirements Development training course</a> that sounds like it is what I need to flesh out my truly lacking skills in this regard.  Only downside is that it is around $2400 for a four day course. Not that $600 a day is that obscene of an amount to charge for a training course.
