Of all the annoying things. I've found myself having to re-create a series of documents due to a massive change of scope in my current project. While doing this, I decided I needed to check to ensure that my Originating Requirements Document matched the standard for this document. So I first looked into the IEEE library. No standard. <span style="font-style: italic;">That's fine,</span> I thought. <span style="font-style: italic;">I can always try DoD</span>.<br /><br />Well, the closest thing to a DoD ORD standard is <a href="http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=205909">DI-IPSC-81430A Operational Concept Description</a>.<br /><br />This particular document has a structure like thus:<br /><blockquote><ol><li>Scope</li><ol><li>Identification</li><li>System Overview<br /></li></ol><li>Referenced Documents</li><li>Current System or Situation</li><ol><li>Background, objectives, and scope</li><li>Operational policies and constraints</li><li>Description of current system or situation</li><li>Users or involved personnel</li><li>Support Concept<br /></li></ol><li>Justification for and nature of Changes</li><ol><li>Justification for change</li><li>Description of needed changes</li><li>Priorities among the changes</li><li>Changes considered but not included</li><li>Assumptions and constraints<br /></li></ol><li>Concept for new or modified system</li><ol><li>Background, objectives, and scope</li><li>Operational policies and constraints</li><li>Description of the new or modified system</li><li>Users/affected personnel</li><li>Support Concept<br /></li></ol><li>Operational Scenarios</li><li>Summary of Impacts</li><ol><li>Operational Impacts</li><li>Organizational Impacts</li><li>Impacts during Development<br /></li></ol><li>Analysis of proposed system</li><ol><li>Summary of Advantages</li><li>Summary of Disadvantages/limitations</li><li>Alternatives and trade-offs considered<br /></li></ol><li>Notes</li></ol></blockquote>While that is all well and good, it is heavily geared towards developing a customized or modified version of an existing system. There are rather large blocks of the document which I would need to tailor out just because I'm developing a new system.<br /><br />Well, since I cannot find an Originating Requirements template that effectively meets my needs, then I am going to be kind of forced to design one. My initial thoughts are thus:<br /><blockquote><ol><li>Identification</li><ol><li>Purpose</li><li>System Overview<br /></li></ol><li>References</li><li>Operational Scenarios</li><li>Originating Requirements</li><li>Notes<br /></li></ol></blockquote><br />When I get a chance, I'll toss this into Word with a bit more thought behind it and worded like an appropriate template for this type of stuff.
