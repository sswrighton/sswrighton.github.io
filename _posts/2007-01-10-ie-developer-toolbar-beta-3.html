I love my Firefox extensions. They do everything from telling me if my HTML/CSS is valid &amp; 508 compliant to giving me download times for a webpage in milliseconds. I have an array of them for Firefox to make my job of creating streamlined webpages fast and easy.<br /><br />And that's one of the good things about IE7 is its ability to be given extensions like Firefox. Though the only one that I have bothered installing so far is the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/01/09/ie-developer-toolbar-beta-3-now-available.aspx">IE Developer Toolbar beta 3</a>.<br /><br />While not quite as well done as the tools in my Firefox arsenal, it's a welcome addition of similar capability in IE, with some nice features that are missing from my Firefox tools.
