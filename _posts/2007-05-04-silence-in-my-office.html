I got a second LCD monitor for my office at work, so now I'm flying high with two of the things. They're quite nice and pretty and bright, and I'm enjoying them immensely. I also got a new PC. I had had the previous one for just shy of 3 years now. But what amazes me about this thing is that I can't hear it.<br /><br />At all.<br /><br />If I didn't know better I would swear this thing just doesn't have a fan in it or a heatsink, it's just that quiet.  Of course that means I have to spend a decent amount of time reconfiguring the machine to work for me. I use a lot of custom settings in all the applications that I use on a consistent basis.  But that's a fun all of its own.
